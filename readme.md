# Order Form

Create an online order form for the bakery - Crab &#174;
<br><br>
### Preparation
 - An index file and another file containing a form are provided.
<br><br>

## Step 1: Accepting Orders
Show an order confirmation when the user submits the form. This should contain the chosen products and delivery address.
<br><br>
## Step 2: Validation
Use PHP to check the following:
- Required fields are not empty.
- Zip code are only numbers.
- Email address is valid.
Show any problems (empty or invalid data) with the fields at the top of the form. If they are valid, the confirmation of step 1 is shown. If the form was not valid, show the previous values in the form so that the user doesn't have to retype everything.
<br><br>
## Step 3: Improve UX by Saving Uer Data
Use PHP session to prefill the address (after the first usage), as long as the browser isn't closed. 
<br><br>
## Step 4: Expanding due to Success
Use the get variables to make a second category of products - pastries. 
Provide a new array for this info (under construction). <br>
The navigation should work as a toggle to switch between the two categories of products.
